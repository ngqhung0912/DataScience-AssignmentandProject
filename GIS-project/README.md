#### - 7 Jupyter Notebooks:

2. GIS-Project-Enschede-South-Analysis: Use to analyze/visualize Enschede Southeast data from GIS-Project-Enschede-South. 
3. GIS-Project-farmland: Use to collect farmland data by CORINE. 
4. GIS-Project-Usselo: Use to collect Usselo satellite image. 
5. GIS-Project-Usselo-Analysis: Use to analyze/visualize Usselo data from GIS-Project-Usselo. 
6. GIS-Project-kasunbrot and GIS-Project-kasunbrot-analysis: Use for the Kas Und Brot region mentioned in the Pause et al. paper, however not mention in the final report. 

For all regions, we follows the same concept: One data-collecting file, and another Analysis file. 
All files are the same, so we will provide documentation on the GIS-Project-Usselo only. The analysis files are straightfoward.
